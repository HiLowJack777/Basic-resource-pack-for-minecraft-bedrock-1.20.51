# Basic-resource-pack-for-minecraft-bedrock-1.20.51
Trying to create a basic resource pack for just dirt blocks
For some reason, my resource pack is not showing up. I am not sure if it is because I am on Xbox One. All my files are named correctly and are in the proper folders on my Xbox. I am not sure what to do. I will upload my files tomorrow. I am following the Microsoft learn tutorials.
